# Mutating Strings - Part 1

<!-- [YouTube](https://youtube.keboo.dev) -->

# Required setup
.NET 7

# Instructions
Within C# [strings are immutable](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/strings/#immutability-of-strings). This brain teaser explores ways to mutate these, typically immutable, objects.

There is a single `MutatingStrings` class that contains a `CauseIdentityCrisis` method as well as a single unit test.
Implement the `CauseIdentityCrisis` method such that the unit test passes. Though you can certainly add additional methods, the solution does not require any changes outside of the `CauseIdentityCrisis` method.

There is a `Hint1.md` and `Hint2.md` files if you are stuck and need some pointers on where to get started.

# Solution
`git switch mutating-strings/part1-solution`
